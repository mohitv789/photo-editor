## 1. Crop tool

This tool works solely on images and has been done so on purpose as the used would not wish to crop other objects, potentially destroying their meaning; for instance cropping a text object would destroy it's ability to be edited.
On clicking on the cropping tool button, the cropping window opens on the canvas for the user the select the region of the photo to crop. The cropping feature can be applied on multiple photos at once.

The tool bar now changes to provide the user with options to crop or cancel the crop selection. If the user deselects the crop selection, the cropping mode is automatically cancelled.

## 2. Clone tool

Clone tool is as simple to use. Select any image object on the canvas and when the selection is active, clicking on the clone tool will create another copy of the object along with the styles currently applied to it.

**Note:** This tool only works on an active image object selection.

## 3. Flip tool

This flip tool can be used to flip an __image__ horizontally. An option to flip vertically has not provided as normal images don't need vertical flips anyway.

**Note:** This tool only works on an active image object selection.

## 4. Filter tool

The filter tool fancies a set of preset filters for casual users, and a set of advanced tools for power users. The filter tool has two modes - single, global. When an image is in selection, the filter mode is automatically turned on to single and any changes will be applied to the __selected image only__. When no image is selected and filter tool is used, the global mode is used and the filters values are applied to __all the images objects__ present on the canvas.
